    <div>
      The tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document. The tag is
      used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or
      manipulated with JavaScript. The tag is easily styled by using the class
      or id attribute. Any sort of content can be put inside the tag! Note: By
      default, browsers always place a line break before and after the element.
